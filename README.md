# 📅 Calendar Generator
This project features a Calendar Generator implemented in both Python 🐍 and C 💻, showcasing different approaches to solving the same problem.

The Python version utilizes the calendar module to provide a straightforward way of generating monthly calendars. It features an interactive menu that allows users to input any year and month, displaying the corresponding calendar in a clean format. Users can seamlessly navigate between months without restarting the program. 🌟

The C version implements a more manual approach, using Zeller's Congruence to calculate the first day of the month and custom logic to determine the number of days in each month, including leap years. It beautifully formats the calendar output with the days aligned, offering a nostalgic command-line experience. 🚀

This dual implementation demonstrates the power and flexibility of programming, whether leveraging libraries for simplicity or crafting logic from scratch for deeper control. 🖥️✨
